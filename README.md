### What is anki?
**anki** - A computer program designed for learning through the method of spaced repetition, where the frequency of repetitions depends on the level and pace of mastering the material. My app is based on it.

In the middle of the main panel, we can see a button labeled **"Stwórz nową talię" (in the future after add EN - "create new deck")**. Clicking on this button will take us to the **new deck creation panel**.

### 4. New deck creation panel
There we need to set 2 things to our deck: **title** and **color**. Dont worry, we can edit both values at any time.

### 5. Managing a created flashcard deck

(in the future after add EN - "Start study!")** If there writes instead **"Odpoczynek" (in the future after add EN - "Rest")** don't worry! It means that you have learned all you need for now, and you can take a break or add new flashcards if you can't get enough of studying. ;D

### 8. Study panel
After starting the study, we can see the study panel. In the upper middle, we can see the **question (front side of the flashcard)**, and below it, there is a button labeled **"Sprawdz!" (in the future after adding EN - "Show answer!")**. After clicking on it, we can see the **answer (back side of the flashcard)** to the question. At the bottom of the study panel, there are three options:\
**1.** A red button labeled "Fatalnie" (in the future after adding EN - "Bad").\
**2.** A cream button labeled "Pół na pół" (in the future after adding EN - "Half and half").\
**3.** A green button labeled "Łatwe!" (in the future after adding EN - "Easy").


# How study its work?
First of all, read the question on the front side of the flashcard and answer it to yourself. Next, click on the **"Sprawdz!" (in the future after adding EN - "Show answer!")** button to check if your answer matches the answer on the back side of the flashcard. Then, decide how well you know the flashcard by selecting one of the options using the buttons at the bottom: bad, half and half, easy. The system will calculate when you need to review the flashcard again.
